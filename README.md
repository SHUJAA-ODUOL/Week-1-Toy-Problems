# Week 1 Toy problems

## Instructions

In this lab i'll be completing the 3 Challenges from the Week 1 Toy problems. This readme file will help in figuring out exactly what you'll need to do throughout this lab in order to complete the lab.

### Tests

When we want to run an experiment, we need to prompt the codes to the console to see whether we are getting the expected return value from our code from the js fil. In programming, we run tests to verify that programs behave the way
we think they do. Tests help us identify bugs and judge how healthy our applications are.

### Code Along
Below are the challenges that need to be complete

//challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

//Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
