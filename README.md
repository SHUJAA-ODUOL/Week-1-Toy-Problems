# Week 1 Toy problems

## Instructions

In this lab i'll be completing the 3 Challenges from the Week 1 Toy problems. This readme file will help in figuring out exactly what you'll need to do throughout this lab in order to complete the lab.

### Tests

When we want to run an experiment, we need to prompt the codes to the console to see whether we are getting the expected return value from our code from the js fil. In programming, we run tests to verify that programs behave the way
we think they do. Tests help us identify bugs and judge how healthy our applications are.
